## **Applicant Project**

Thanks for applying to GoReact! To help us learn more about you and give you an opportunity to show us your stuff, we&#39;d like you to build a simple web application. We will go over the requirements for what this web application needs to do, but you are free to write it using any tools/technologies/frameworks/languages/whatever you want. We want to see how you think, solve problems and build solutions.

## **The Project**

The challenge is to build a simple yet effective TODO application. The application must perform the following items

- Create a todo
- Remove a todo
- Update the status of a todo (toggle its done state)
- List out all the todos
- Persist todos between page loads

You must use the following items in your project

- A frontend framework (We use Angular)
- A backend API for creating, removing, updating and fetching todos. (We use PHP Laravel)
- A database for storing the todos. (We use MySQL)
- Contain a README that explains how to set up and run your project, as well as how to execute your tests.
- Client and server side unit testing. (We use Jasmine for client testing)
  - We do lots and lots of unit, integration, API and end-to-end testing at GoReact. We have a robust automated testing and deployment pipeline. We expect you to write tests for your code in the project. Both for the front end and back end. If you&#39;ve never written tests before, now is a great time to learn.

**Extra Credit**

We would also like to see you expand your application in an area that you are passionate about. Here are some examples:

- Create a downloadable mobile friendly PWA
- Create end to end tests with something like cypress
- Show off your css skills by using CSS Grid
- Work offline
- Individual accounts with authentication
- Search for TODOs

## **Submission**

1. Send us a link to the code you have written (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc)
2. Report on how long it took you.
3. Record yourself demo-ing your project where you walk us through all the functionality and code, including running your tests, and provide us a link to this demo video.

## **Timeline**

We expect you to take somewhere between 2-5 hours to complete this and would love to see your project within 3 days of us sending this request to you. If you need more time because you want to go above and beyond, or if you are just needing more time, just reach out and let us know why.
