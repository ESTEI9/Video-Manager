# applicant-project

Thanks for applying to GoReact! To help us learn more about you and give you an opportunity to show us your stuff, we'd like you to build a simple web application.  We will go over the requirements for what this web application needs to do, but you are free to write it using whatever tools/technologies/internet you want.  We don't care.  We want to see how you think and how you solve problems and build solutions.

## The Project
We do a lot with media and files at GoReact, so we'd like you to build a simple file manager app.  We only want to see a few things from this app:

* Allow uploading and persisting `.jpg` and `.mp4` files
* Show a UI where users can upload new files, and show the list of files uploaded so far
* A way to "preview" the uploaded files.  For images, we want to see the image, and for mp4's, play the video.

It also goes with out saying, your project should include a `README` that explains how to run it, set it up, run any tests if you have them, etc.

**MAKE SURE YOU TEST YOUR INSTRUCTIONS YOURSELF**.

You don't want us to tell you your instructions don't work.

## Extra Requirements
In addition to the above requirements, we want you to choose at *least* one more from the list below to include in your implementation:

* Write tests for your code, and document a way to run them
* Add a login mechanism, and allow each user to have their own list of files
* Add a way to add a title, description and tags to a file and have those changes persist.  Allow for filtering the list of files with search terms that can match these new fields.
* Use S3 or some other cloud based storage for the files
* In addition to `mp4` and `jpg`, support `pdf` files, including the ability to render and preview them
* Add player controls when previewing `mp4` files.  Include controls that allow for:
   * Skipping forward and back 10 seconds
   * Pause/Play
   * Speed up/slow down playback

## Timeline
We would love to see your project within a week of us sending this request to you.  If you need more time because you want to go above and beyond, or if you are just needing more time for any reason, just reach out and let us know.
